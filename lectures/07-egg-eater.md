Next, lets add support for

* **Data Structures**

In the process of doing so, we will learn about

* **Heap Allocation**

* **Run-time Tags**

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Creating Heap Data Structures

We have already support for _two_ primitive data types

```haskell
data Ty
  = TNumber     -- e.g. 0,1,2,3,...
  | TBoolean    -- e.g. true, false
```

we could add several more of course, e.g.

* `Char`
* `Double` or `Float`

etc. (you should do it!)

However, for all of those, the same principle applies, more or less

* As long as the data fits into a single word (8-bytes)

Instead, lets learn how to make **unbounded data structures**

* Lists
* Trees
* ...

which require us to put data on the **heap** 

> not just the _stack_ that we've used so far.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Pairs

While our _goal_ is to get to lists and trees,
the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step...

So! we will _begin_ with the humble **pair**.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Pairs: Semantics (Behavior)

First, lets ponder what exactly we're trying to achieve. 

We want to enrich our language with _two_ new constructs:

* **Constructing** pairs, with a new expression of the
  form `(e0, e1)` where `e0` and `e1` are expressions.

* **Accessing** pairs, with new expressions of the
  form `e[0]` and `e[1]` which evaluate to the first
  and second element of the tuple `e` respectively.

For example,

```haskell
let t = (2, 3) in  
  t[0] + t[1]
```

should evaluate to `5`.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Strategy

Next, lets informally develop a strategy for extending our language
with pairs, implementing the above semantics. We need to work out
strategies for:

1. **Representing** pairs in the machine's memory,
2. **Constructing** pairs (i.e. implementing `(e0, e1)` in assembly),
3. **Accessing** pairs (i.e. implementing `e[0]` and `e[1]` in assembly).

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 1. Representation

Recall that we [represent all values:](05-cobra.md/#option-2-use-a-tag-bit)

* `Number` like `0`, `1`, `2` ...
* `Boolean` like `true`, `false`

as a **single word** either

* 8 bytes on the stack, or
* a single register `rax`, `rcx` etc.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## EXERCISE

What kinds of problems do you think might arise if
we represent a pair `(2, 3)` on the _stack_ as:

```
|     |
-------
|  3  |
-------
|  2  |  
-------
| ... |
-------
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## QUIZ

How many words would we need to store the tuple

```python
(3, (4, 5))
```

1. `1` word
2. `2` words
3. `3` words
4. `4` words
5. `5` words

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<!--  
### Pairs vs. Primitive Values

The main difference between pairs and primitive values
like `number` and `boolean` is that there is no _fixed_
or _bounded_ amount of space we can give to a pair.
For example:

* `(4, 5)` takes at least 2 words,
* `(3, (4, 5))` takes at least 3 words,
* `(2, (3, (4, 5)))` takes at least 4 words  and so on.

Thus, once you start _nesting_ pairs we can't neatly tuck
all the data into a fixed number of 1- or 2- word slots.

-->

### Pointers

> Every problem in computing can be solved by adding a level of indirection.

We will **represent a pair** by a **pointer** to a block of **two adjacent words** of memory.

![Pairs on the heap](/static/img/heap-pairs.png)

The above shows how the pair `(2, (3, (4, 5)))` and its sub-pairs
can be stored in the **heap** using pointers.

`(4, 5)` is stored by adjacent words storing

* `4` and
* `5`

`(3, (4, 5))` is stored by adjacent words storing

* `3` and
* a **pointer** to a heap location storing `(4, 5)`

`(2, (3, (4, 5)))` is stored by adjacent words storing

* `2` and
* a **pointer** to a heap location storing `(3, (4, 5))`.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## A Problem: Numbers vs. Pointers?

How will we tell the difference between _numbers_ and _pointers_?

That is, how can we tell the difference between

1. the _number_ 5 and
2. a _pointer_ to a block of memory (with address `5`)?

Each of the above corresponds to a _different_ tuple

1. `(4, 5)` or
2. `(4, (...))`.

so its pretty crucial that we have a way of knowing _which_ value it is.


<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Tagging Pointers

As you might have guessed, we can extend our [tagging mechanism](05-cobra.md/#option-2-use-a-tag-bit)
to account for _pointers_.

| Type      | LSB |
|----------:|----:|
| `number`  | xx0 |
| `boolean` | 111 |
| `pointer` | 001 |

That is, for

* `number` the **last bit** will be `0` (as before),
* `boolean` the **last 3 bits** will be `111` (as before), and
* `pointer` the **last 3 bits** will be `001`.

(We have 3-bits worth for tags, so have wiggle room for other primitive types.)

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Address Alignment

As we have a **3 bit tag**

* leaving **64 - 3 = 61 bits** for the actual address

So actual addresses, written in binary, omitting trailing zeros, are of the form

|  Binary      |  Decimal |
|-------------:|---------:|
| `0b00000000` |        0 |
| `0b00001000` |        8 |
| `0b00010000` |       16 |
| `0b00011000` |       24 |
| `0b00100000` |       32 |
| ...          |          |


That is, the addresses are **8-byte aligned**.

Which is great because at each address, we have
a pair, i.e. a **2-word = 16-byte block**, so the 
_next_ allocated address will *also* fall on an 8-byte boundary.

* But ... what if we had 3-tuples? or 5-tuples? ...

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 2. Construction

Next, lets look at how to implement pair **construction**
that is, generate the assembly for expressions like:

```python
(e1, e2)
```

To **construct** a pair `(e1, e2)` we

1. **Allocate** a new 2-word block, and getting the starting address at `rax`,
2. **Copy** the value of `e1` (resp. `e2`) into `[rax]` (resp. `[rax + 8]`).
3. **Tag** the last bit of `rax` with `1`.

The resulting `eax` is the **value of the pair**

* The _last step_ ensures that the value carries the proper tag.

ANF will ensure that `e1` and `e2` are [immediate expressions](04-boa.md/#idea-immediate-expressions)

* will make the second step above straightforward.

**EXERCISE** How will we do ANF conversion for `(e1, e2)`?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Allocating Addresses

Lets use a **global** register `r15` to maintain 
the address of the **next free block** on the heap. 

Every time we need a _new_ block, we will:

**1. Copy** the current `r15` into `rax`

+ Set the last bit to `1` to ensure proper tagging.
+ `rax` will be used to fill in the values

**2. Increment** the value of `r15` by `16`

+ Thus _allocating_ 8 bytes (= 2 words) at the address in `rax`

Note that addresses stay 8-byte aligned (last 3 bits = 0) if we  

* _Start_ our blocks at an 8-byte boundary, and
* _Allocate_ 16 bytes at a time,


**NOTE:** Your assignment will have *blocks of varying sizes* 

* You will have to _maintain_ the 8-byte alignment by _padding_

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Example: Allocation

In the figure below, we have

* a source program on the left,
* the ANF equivalent next to it.

![Example of Pairs](/static/img/example-pair-code.png)

The figure below shows the how the heap and `r15` evolve at points 1, 2 and 3:

![Allocating Pairs on the Heap](/static/img/example-pair-heaps.png)

## QUIZ

In the ANF version, `p` is the _second (local) variable_ stored
in the stack frame. What _value_ gets moved into the _second stack slot_
when evaluating the above program?

1. `0x3`
2. `(3, (4, 5))`
3. `0x11`
4. `0x9`
5. `0x10`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## 3. Accessing

Finally, to **access** the elements of a pair

Lets compile `e[0]` to get the first or `e[1]` to get the second element

1. **Check** that immediate value `e` is a pointer
2. **Load** `e` into `rcx`
3. **Remove** the tag bit from `rcx`
4. **Copy** the value in `[rcx]` (resp. `[rcx + 8]`) into `rcx`.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Example: Access

Here is a snapshot of the heap after the pair(s) are allocated.

![Allocating Pairs on the Heap](/static/img/example-pair-heap.png)

Lets work out how the values corresponding to `x`, `y`
and `z` in the example above get stored on the stack
frame in the course of evaluation.

| Variable |   Hex Value | Value    |   
|---------:|------------:| --------:|
| `anf0`   | `0x001`     | `ptr 0`  |
|    `p`   | `0x011`     | `ptr 16` |
|    `x`   | `0x006`     | `num 3`  |
| `anf1`   | `0x001`     | `ptr 0`  |
|    `y`   | `0x008`     | `num 4`  |
|    `z`   | `0x00A`     | `num 5`  |
| `anf2`   | `0x00E`     | `num 7`  |  
| result   | `0x018`     | `num 12` |

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Plan

Pretty pictures are well and good, time to build stuff!

As usual, lets continue with our recipe:

1. Run-time
2. Types
3. Transforms

We've already built up intuition of the _strategy_ for implementing tuples. 

Next, lets look at how to implement each of the above.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Run-Time

We need to extend the run-time (`c-bits/main.c`) in two ways.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

1. **Allocate** a chunk of space on the heap and pass in
   start address to `our_code`.

2. **Print** pairs properly.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Allocation

The first step is quite easy we can use `calloc` as follows:

```c
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int* HEAP = calloc(HEAP_SIZE, sizeof (int));
  long result = our_code_starts_here(HEAP);
  print(result);
  return 0;
}
```

The above code,

1. **Allocates** a big block of contiguous memory (starting at `HEAP`), and
2. **Passes** this address in to `our_code`.

Now, `our_code` needs to, at the beginning start with instructions that

* copy the parameter (in `rdi`) into global pointer (`r15`) 
* and then bump it up at each allocation.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Printing

To print pairs, we must **recursively traverse** pointers 

* until we hit `number` or `boolean`.

We can check if a value is a pair by looking at its last 3 bits:

```c
int isPair(int p) {
  return (p & 0x00000007) == 0x00000001;
}
```

We can use the above test to recursively print (word)-values:

```c
void print(long val) {
  if(val & 0x1 == 0) { // val is a number
    printf("%ld", val >> 1);
  }
  else if(val == CONST_TRUE) {        // val is true
    printf("true");
  }
  else if(val == CONST_FALSE) {       // val is false
    printf("false");
  }
  else if(val & 7 == 1) {            
    long* valp = (long *) (val - 1);  // extract address  
    printf("(");
    print(*valp);                     // print first element
    printf(", ");
    print(*(valp + 1));               // print second element
    printf(")");
  }
  else {
    printf("Unknown value: %#010x", val);
  }
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Types

Next, lets move into our compiler, and see how the
**core types** need to be extended.

### Source

We need to extend the _source_ `Expr` with support for tuples

```haskell
data Expr a
  = ...
  | Pair    (Expr a) (Expr a) a   -- ^ construct a pair
  | GetItem (Expr a) Field    a   -- ^ access a pair's element
```

In the above, `Field` is

```haskell
data Field
  = First     -- ^ access first element of pair
  | Second    -- ^ access second element of pair
```

**NOTE:** Your assignment will generalize pairs to **n-ary tuples** using

* `Tuple [Expr a]` representing `(e1,...,en)`
* `GetItem (Expr a) (Expr a)` representing `e1[e2]`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Dynamic Types

Let us extend our **dynamic types** `Ty` [see](05-cobra.md/#types)
to include pairs:

```haskell
data Ty = TNumber | TBoolean | TPair
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Assembly

The assembly `Instruction` are changed minimally;
we just need access to `r15` which will hold the
value of the _next_ available memory block:

```haskell
data Register
  = ...
  | R15
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Transforms

Our code must take care of three things:

1. **Initialize** `r15` to allow heap allocation,
2. **Construct** pairs,
3. **Access** pairs.

The latter two will be pointed out as cases in `anf` and `compileEnv` 

* `Tuple` 
* `GetItem`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Initialize

We need to **initialize** `r15` with the **start position** of the heap

- passed in as `rdi` by the run-time.

How shall we get a hold of this position?

To do so, `our_code` starts off with a `prelude`

```haskell
prelude :: [Instruction]
prelude =
  [ IMov (Reg R15) (Reg RDI)    -- copy param (HEAP) off rdi
  ]
```

Is that it?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

**QUIZ**

Is `r15` 8-byte aligned?

(A) Yes
(B) No

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Ensuring alignment

```haskell
prelude :: [Instruction]
prelude =
  [ IMov (Reg RAX) (HexConst 0xFFFFFFFF)      -- setup regMask
  , IShl (Reg RAX) (Const 32)
  , IOr  (Reg RAX) (HexConst 0xFFFFFFF8)

  , IMov (Reg R15) (Reg RDI)                  -- copy param (HEAP) off rdi
  , IAdd (Reg R15) (Const 8)                  -- add 8 and mask 3 bits to ensure
  , IAnd (Reg R15) (Reg RAX)                  -- 8-byte aligned
  ]
```

1. **Copy** the value off the (parameter) stack, and
2. **Adjust** the value to ensure the value is _8-byte aligned_.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## QUIZ

Why add `8` to `r15`? What would happen if we *removed* that operation?

1. `r15` would not be 8-byte aligned?
2. `r15` would point into the stack?
3. `r15` would not point into the heap?
4. `r15` would not have enough space to write 2 bytes?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Construct

To _construct_ a pair `(v1, v2)` we directly implement the
[above strategy](07-egg-eater.md/#2-construction):

```haskell
compileEnv env (Tuple v1 v2)
  = pairAlloc                        -- 1. allocate pair, resulting addr in `rax`
 ++ pairCopy First  (immArg env v1)  -- 2. copy first value into slots
 ++ pairCopy Second (immArg env v2)  -- 3. copy second value into slot 
 ++ setTag   RAX     TPair           -- 3. set the tag-bits of `rax`
```

Lets look at each step in turn.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Allocate

To allocate, we just copy the current pointer `r15` and increment by `16` bytes,

* accounting for two 8-byte blocks for each element.

```haskell
pairAlloc :: Asm
pairAlloc
  = [ IMov (Reg RAX) (Reg R15)    -- copy current "free address" `esi` into `eax`
    , IAdd (Reg RAX) (Const 16)   -- increment `esi` by 8
    ]
```

**Exercise** How would you make this work for `n`-tuples?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Copy

We copy an `Arg` into a `Field` by

* saving the `Arg` into a helper register `rcx`,

* copying `rcx` into the field's slot on the heap.

```haskell
pairCopy :: Field -> Arg -> Asm
pairCopy fld arg
  = [ IMov (Reg RBX)      arg
    , IMov (pairAddr fld) (Reg RBX)
    ]
```

Recall, the field's slot is either `[rax]` or `[rax + 8]` depending
on whether the field is `First` or `Second`.

## QUIZ 

What shall we fill in for `_1` and `_2` ?

```haskell
pairAddr :: Field -> Arg
pairAddr First  = RegOffset ?1 RAX
pairAddr Second = RegOffset ?2 RAX
```

**A.** `0` and `1`

**B.** `0` and `-1`

**C.** `1` and `2`

**D.** `-1` and `-2`

**E.** huh?

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Tag

Finally, we set the tag bits of `rax` by using `typeTag TPair`
which is defined

```haskell
setTag :: Register -> Asm
setTag r = [ IAdd (Reg r) (HexConst 0x1) ]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Access

To access tuples, lets update `compileEnv` with the [strategy above](#3-accessing):

```haskell
compileExpr env (GetItem e fld)
  = assertType env e TPair              -- 1. check that e is a (pair) pointer
 ++ [ IMov (Reg RAX) (immArg env e) ]   -- 2. load pointer into eax
 ++ unsetTag RAX                        -- 3. remove tag bit to get address
 ++ [ IMov (Reg RAX) (pairAddr fld) ]   -- 4. copy value from resp. slot to eax
```

we remove the tag bits by doing the opposite of `setTag` namely:

```haskell
unsetTag :: Register -> Asm
unsetTag r = ISub (Reg RAX) (HexConst 0x1)
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## N-ary Tuples

Thats it! Lets take our compiler out for a spin, by using it to write some
interesting programs!

First, lets see how to generalize pairs to allow for

* triples `(e1,e2,e3)`
* quadruples `(e1,e2,e3,e4)`
* pentuples `(e1,e2,e3,e4,e5)`

and so on.

We just need a library of functions in our new `egg` language to

* **Construct** such tuples, and
* **Access** their fields.

### Constructing Tuples

We can write a small set of functions to **construct** tuples (up to some given size):

```python
def tup3(x1, x2, x3):
  (x1, (x2, x3))

def tup4(x1, x2, x3, x4):
  (x1, (x2, (x3, x4)))

def tup5(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5):
  (x1, (x2, (x3, (x4, x5))))
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


## Accessing Tuples

We can write a single function to access tuples of any size.

So the below code

```python
let yuple = (10, (20, (30, (40, (50, false))))) in 

get(yuple, 0) = 10
get(yuple, 1) = 20
get(yuple, 2) = 30
get(yuple, 3) = 40
get(yuple, 4) = 50




def tup3(x1, x2, x3):
  (x1, (x2, x3))

def tup5(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5):
  (x1, (x2, (x3, (x4, x5))))

let t  = tup5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in
  , x0 = print(get(t, 0))
  , x1 = print(get(t, 1))
  , x2 = print(get(t, 2))
  , x3 = print(get(t, 3))
  , x4 = print(get(t, 4))
in
  99
```

should print out:

```
0
1
2
3
4
99
```

How shall we write it?

```python
def get(t, i):
  TODO-IN-CLASS
```

## QUIZ

Using the above "library" we can write code like:

```haskell
let quad = tup4(1, 2, 3, 4) in
  get(quad, 0) + get(quad, 1) + get(quad, 2) + get(quad, 3)
```

What will be the result of compiling the above?

1. Compile error
2. Segmentation fault
3. Other run-time error
4. `4`
5. `10`

## QUIZ

Using the above "library" we can write code like:

```haskell
def get(t, i):
  if i == 0:
    t[0]
  else:
    get(t[1],i-1)

def tup3(x1, x2, x3):
  (x1, (x2, (x3, false)))

let quad = tup3(1, 2, 3) in
  get(quad, 0) + get(quad, 1) + get(quad, 2) + get(quad, 3)
```

What will be the result of compiling the above?

1. Compile error
2. Segmentation fault
3. Other run-time error
4. `4`
5. `10`

## Lists

Once we have pairs, we can start encoding **unbounded lists**.

To build a list, we need two constructor functions:

```python
def empty():
  false

def cons(h, t):
  (h, t)
``

We can now encode lists as:

```python
cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, cons(4, empty()))))
```

## Access

To **access** a list, we need to know

1. Whether the list `isEmpty`, and
2. A way to access the `head` and the `tail` of a non-empty list.

```haskell
def isEmpty(l):
  l == empty()

def head(l):
  l[0]

def tail(l):
  l[1]
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Examples

We can now write various functions that build and operate on lists,
for example, a function to generate the list of numbers between `i` and `j`

```python
def range(i, j):
  if (i < j):
    cons(i, range(i+1, j))
  else:
    empty()

range(1, 5)
```

which should produce the result

`(1,(2,(3,(4,false))))`

and a function to sum up the elements of a list:

```python
def sum(xs):
  if (isEmpty(xs)):
    0
  else:
    head(xs) + sum(tail(xs))

sum(range(1, 5))
```

which should produce the result `10`.

## Recap

We have a pretty serious language now, with:

* **Data Structures**

which are implemented using

* **Heap Allocation**
* **Run-time Tags**

which required a bunch of small but subtle changes in the

* runtime and compiler

In your assignment, you will add _native_ support for n-ary
tuples, letting the programmer write code like:

```python
(e1, e2, e3, ..., en)  # constructing tuples of arbitrary arity

e1[e2]                 # allowing expressions to be used as fields
```

Next, we'll see how to

* use the "tuple" mechanism to implement **higher-order functions** and

* reclaim unused memory via **garbage collection**.
