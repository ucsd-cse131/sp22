## Regrade Requests for Exams

First, a deadline
Second, rules about how a regrade request should be formatted.
Something like all regrade requests should be:
"(1) Here is the correct answer: XYZ (2) here is my answer: ABC (3) here is why I think I was incorrectly graded"
even when we were in person, I was doing regrade requests on gradescope, if you limit it to 24 hours, it's quick.
the thing is, you actually do find cases where there are genuine grading mistakes.
Btw, the key with regrade requests imo is for them to first figure out the correct answer. This will cause students to try out their solution, or dig into it, and will prevent a lot of "my answer is clearly correct", when it's not.
Also: if they do not format their request properly, I say they will lose more points (I never did it, but had to remind one student that if they continue, they will lose points, and they stopped right away)
