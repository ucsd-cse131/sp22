<!-- 
- **Class Participation (5%)** :
  Involves answering questions with the clicker.
  Register your clicker [in this google form](https://goo.gl/forms/qL6E5ADtYVz600iE2) 
  - Use your PID `A0XXXXXXXXX`

- **(6-7) Homework Assignments (35%)** :
  They may be **done in pairs**; they will be assigned at
  the rate of one per week. You have a total of *six late days*
  that you can use throughout the quarter as you need them,
  where a late day means anything between 1 second and 23
  hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.

- **Synchronized Midterm (30%)** :
  Will be held on **Tuesday May 4th, from 9:30 -- 10:50am**.

- **Synchronized Final (35%)** :
  Will be held on **Tuesday June 8th, from 8:00 -- 11:00am**.
 
- Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as 
  `midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`. This means that you get a second 
  chance if you donâ€™t do well on the midterm but you must turn in both the 
  midterm and the final.

Exams **must** be taken at the scheduled time.
They are open book, notes, computer etc. but 
you cannot collaborate with **anyone** in person 
or online sites like stack overflow etc.
