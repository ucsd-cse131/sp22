## Overview

This is a _warm up_ assignment which will

* refresh your memory of functional programming from CSE 130, and
* provide a quick introduction to Haskell.

To this end, you will, reimplement certain problems from
CSE 130 in Haskell. Recall that the problems require
relatively little code ranging from 2 to 15 lines.
If any function requires more than that, you can be
sure that you need to rethink your solution.

1. [lib/Hw0.hs](/lib/Hw0.hs) has skeleton functions with
   missing bodies that you will fill in,
2. [tests/Test.hs](/tests/Test.hs) has some sample tests,
   and testing code that you will use to check your
   assignments before submitting.

You should only need to modify the parts of the files which say:

```haskell
error "TBD: ..."
```

with suitable Haskell implementations.

**Note:** Start early, to avoid any unexpected shocks late in the day.

## Assignment Testing and Evaluation

Your functions/programs **must** compile and run on `ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

Most of the points, will be awarded automatically, by
**evaluating your functions against a given test suite**.

[Tests.hs](/tests/Test.hs) contains a very small suite
of tests which gives you a flavor of of these tests.
When you run

```shell
$ stack test
```

Your last lines should have

```
All N tests passed (...)
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**or**

```
K out of N tests failed
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**If your output does not have one of the above your code will receive a zero**

If for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile,
leave it as is with the `error ...` with your partial
solution enclosed below as a comment.

The other lines will give you a readout for each test.
You are encouraged to try to understand the testing code,
but you will not be graded on this.

## Submission Instructions

To submit your code, just do:

```bash
$ make turnin 
```

`turnin` will provide you with a confirmation of the
submission process; make sure that the size of the file
indicated by `turnin` matches the size of your file.
See the ACS Web page on [turnin](https://acms.ucsd.edu/info/turnin.html)
for more information on the operation of the program.

## Problem 1: [Roots and Persistence](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdditivePersistence.html)

### (a) 10 points

Fill in the implementation of

```haskell
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList xs = error "TBD:sumList"
```

that such that `sumList xs` returns the sum of the integer elements of
`xs`. Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following
behavior at the prompt:

```haskell
ghci> sumList [1, 2, 3, 4]
10

ghci> sumList [1, -2, 3, 5]
7

ghci> sumList [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
36
```

## (b) 10 points

Fill in the implementation of the function

```haskell
digitsOfInt :: Int -> [Int]
digitsOfInt n = error "TBD:digitsOfInt"
```

such that `digitsOfInt n`

* returns `[]` if `n` is not positive, and otherwise
* returns the list of digits of `n` in the order in which they appear in `n`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following:

```haskell
ghci> digitsOfInt 3124
[3, 1, 2, 4]

ghci> digitsOfInt 352663
[3, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3]
```

### (c) 10+10 points

Consider the process of taking a number, adding its digits,
then adding the digits of the number derived from it, etc.,
until the remaining number has only one digit.
The number of additions required to obtain a single digit
from a number `n` is called the *additive persistence* of `n`,
and the digit obtained is called the *digital root* of `n`.

For example, the sequence obtained from the starting number
`9876` is `9876`, `30`, `3`, so `9876` has an additive
persistence of `2` and a digital root of `3`.

Write two functions

```haskell
additivePersistence :: Int -> Int
additivePersistence n = error "TBD:additivePersistence"

digitalRoot :: Int -> Int
digitalRoot n = error "TBD:digitalRoot"
```

that take positive integer arguments `n` and return respectively
the additive persistence and the digital root of `n`. Once you
have implemented the functions, you should get the following
behavior at the prompt:

```haskell
ghci> additivePersistence 9876
2

ghci> digitalRoot 9876
3
```

## Problem 2: Palindromes

### (a) 15 points

Without using any built-in functions (e.g. `reverse`),
write an function:

```haskell
listReverse :: [a] -> [a]
listReverse xs = error "TBD:listReverse"
```

such that `listReverse [x1,x2,...,xn]` returns the list `[xn,...,x2,x1]`
i.e. the input list but with the values in reversed order.
You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> listReverse [1, 2, 3, 4]
[4, 3, 2, 1]

ghci> listReverse ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
["d", "c", "b", "a"]
```

###(b) 10 points

A *palindrome* is a word that reads the same from left-to-right and
right-to-left. Write a function

```haskell
palindrome :: String -> Bool
palindrome w = error "TBD:palindrome"
```

such that `palindrome w` returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and
`False` otherwise. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> palindrome "malayalam"
True
ghci> palindrome "myxomatosis"
False
```

## Problem 3: Folding Warm-Up

### (a) 15 points

Fill in the skeleton given for `sqsum`,
which uses `foldl'` (the equivalent of Ocaml's `List.fold_left`)
to get a function

```haskell
sqSum :: [Int] -> Int
```

such that `sqSum [x1,...,xn]` returns the integer `x1^2 + ... + xn^2`

Your task is to fill in the appropriate values for

1. the folding function `f` and
2. the base case `base`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get
the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> sqSum []
0

ghci> sqSum [1, 2, 3, 4]
30

ghci> sqSum [(-1), (-2), (-3), (-4)]
30
```

### (b) 30 points
Fill in the skeleton given for `pipe` which uses `foldl'`
to get a function

```haskell
pipe :: [(a -> a)] -> (a -> a)
```

such that `pipe [f1,...,fn] x` (where `f1,...,fn` are functions!)
should return `f1(f2(...(fn x)))`.

Again, your task is to fill in the appropriate values for

1. the folding function `f` and
2. the base case `base`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get
the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> pipe [] 3
3

ghci> pipe [(\x -> x+x), (\x -> x + 3)] 3
12

ghci> pipe [(\x -> x * 4), (\x -> x + x)] 3
24
```


### (c) 20 points

Fill in the skeleton given for `sepConcat`,
which uses `foldl'` to get a function

```haskell
sepConcat :: String -> [String] -> String
```

Intuitively, the call `sepConcat sep [s1,...,sn]` where

* `sep` is a string to be used as a separator, and
* `[s1,...,sn]` is a list of strings

should behave as follows:


* `sepConcat sep []` should return the empty string `""`,
* `sepConcat sep [s]` should return just the string `s`,
* otherwise (if there is more than one string) the output
  should be the string `s1 ++ sep ++ s2 ++ ... ++ sep ++ sn`.

You should only modify the parts of the skeleton consisting
of `error "TBD" "`. You will need to define the function `f`,
and give values for `base` and `l`.

Once done, you should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> sepConcat ", " ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
"foo, bar, baz"

ghci> sepConcat "---" []
""

ghci> sepConcat "" ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
"abcde"

ghci> sepConcat "X" ["hello"]
"hello"
```

### (d) 10 points

Implement the function

```haskell
stringOfList :: (a -> String) -> [a] -> String
```

such that `stringOfList f [x1,...,xn]` should return the string
`"[" ++ (f x1) ++ ", " ++ ... ++ (f xn) ++ "]"`

This function can be implemented on one line,
**without using any recursion** by calling
`map` and `sepConcat` with appropriate inputs.

You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> stringOfList show [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

ghci> stringOfList (fun x -> x) ["foo"]
"[foo]"

ghci> stringOfList (stringOfList show) [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], []]
"[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], []]"
```

## Problem 4: Big Numbers

The Haskell type `Int` only contains values up to a certain size (for reasons
that will become clear as we implement our own compiler). For example,

```haskell
ghci> let x = 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 :: Int

<interactive>:3:9: Warning:
    Literal 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
```

You will now implement functions to manipulate arbitrarily large
numbers represented as `[Int]`, i.e. lists of `Int`.

### (a) 10 + 5 + 10 points

Write a function

```haskell
clone :: a -> Int -> [a]
```

such that `clone x n` returns a list of `n` copies of the value `x`.
If the integer `n` is `0` or negative, then `clone` should return
the empty list. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> clone 3 5
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

ghci> clone "foo" 2
["foo", "foo"]
```

Use `clone` to write a function

```haskell
padZero :: [Int] -> [Int] -> ([Int], [Int])
```

which takes two lists: `[x1,...,xn]` `[y1,...,ym]` and
adds zeros in front of the _shorter_ list to make the
lists equal.

Your implementation should *not** be recursive.

You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> padZero [9, 9] [1, 0, 0, 2]
([0, 0, 9, 9], [1, 0, 0, 2])

ghci> padZero [1, 0, 0, 2] [9, 9]
([1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 9, 9])
```

Next, write a function

```haskell
removeZero :: [Int] -> [Int]
```

that takes a list and removes a prefix of leading zeros, yielding
the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> removeZero [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
[1, 0, 0, 2]

ghci> removeZero [9, 9]
[9, 9]

ghci> removeZero [0, 0, 0, 0]
[]
```

### (b) 25 points

Let us use the list `[d1, d2, ..., dn]`, where each `di`
is between `0` and `9`, to represent the (positive)
**big-integer** `d1d2...dn`.

```haskell
type BigInt = [Int]
```

For example, `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8]` represents
the big-integer `9999999998`. Fill out the implementation for

```haskell
bigAdd :: BigInt -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

so that it takes two integer lists, where each integer is
between `0` and `9` and returns the list corresponding to
the addition of the two big-integers. Again, you have to
fill in the implementation to supply the appropriate values
to `f`, `base`, `args`. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> bigAdd [9, 9] [1, 0, 0, 2]
[1, 1, 0, 1]

ghci> bigAdd [9, 9, 9, 9] [9, 9, 9]
[1, 0, 9, 9, 8]
```

### (c) 15 + 20 points

Next you will write functions to multiply two big integers.
First write a function

```haskell
mulByDigit :: Int -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

which takes an integer digit and a big integer, and returns the
big integer list which is the result of multiplying the big
integer with the digit. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> mulByDigit 9 [9,9,9,9]
[8,9,9,9,1]
```

Now, using `mulByDigit`, fill in the implementation of

```haskell
bigMul :: BigInt -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

Again, you have to fill in implementations for `f` , `base` , `args` only.
Once you are done, you should get the following behavior at the prompt:

```haskell
ghci> bigMul [9,9,9,9] [9,9,9,9]
[9,9,9,8,0,0,0,1]

ghci> bigMul [9,9,9,9,9] [9,9,9,9,9]
[9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,1]
```
